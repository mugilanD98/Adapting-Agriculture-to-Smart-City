# Adapting-Agriculture-to-Smart-City
In order to preserve and maintain agricultural resources I designed a database structure (ER Diagram) that consists of multiple related tables with details about agricultural properties, farmers in Tamil Nadu and real time data from sensors

Approach: Research on Farmers and Agricultural property data
maintained by government such as Farmer card, Land
Registrations, Transmission lines etc., Designed own tables
based on modern sensors, Set Primary and Foreign Keys,
Mapped the tables
